This is github repository for my fan controller I built around an esp32, fs1000a 433mhz rf transmitter, Dallastemperature ds18b20 temperature sensor, Shift register 74HC595, Led bargraph to map temperature range
from 15c to 30c. Uses two leds red and green to see if ntp server was sucessfdully connected and fetched time.
